    "text": "Gliomas are a diverse group of primary brain tumors (tumors that originate in the brain) that (debated) originate from glial cells in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive form, accounts for approximately 45 to 50% of all primary brain cancers with an annual incidence of 3-5 cases per 100000 individuals, globally. Despite various advances in treatment strategy, including the combined use of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and advanced techniques like Tumor Treating Fields (TTFIelds) and Immunotherapy, the median survival for GBM remains at 12-15 months, with a two-year survival rate below a grim 30%. (Sipos D et. al., 2025)\nIn contrast to GBM, lower grade gliomas (LGG), follow a more, indolent, so to speak, clinical course. LGG patients have substantially better prognoses, although dependent on the molecular features and extent of surgical resection. However, over 70% of LGG cases typically transform into higher-grade tumors within a decade and often end up progressing to GBM.\nThe difference in survival and patient outcome between GBM and LGG makes understanding what factors influence the prognosis important for clinical decisions. (Fernandes C et. al., 2017)\nRadiation therapy has long been a cornerstone of glioma treatment, though its effects vary substaintially between tumor grades. Recent research seems to suggest that radiation impacts survival very differently in GBM vs LGG. LGG patients show shorter survival after radiation, whuch may stem from the weaker DNA repair mechanisms in GBM making them more vulnerable to radiation-induced damage, while the same cannot be said for LGG.\nTo address these critical questions about glioma survival patterns and treatment effects, I leveraged data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBMLGG Cohort, downloaded from UCSC Xena."

    "text": "Limitations\nBecause this is an observational study, it cannot establish causality between treatment and outcome. There is some missing data for certain variables regarding treatment modalities beyond radiation therapy and prognostically important molecular markers like IDH mutations and 1p/19q co-deletions)\nThis data is also not fully up-to-date with the most current treatment strategies like TTFields and Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy. There may also be some selection bias because the TCGA patients may not fully represent the general glioma population.\nTo conclude- This analysis provides evidence for the very distinct biological and clinical characteristics of GBM versus LGG, and shows the substantial survival benefit of radiation therapy especially in GBM, and confirms age as an independent prognostic factor across the glioma subtypes."
